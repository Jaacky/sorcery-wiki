Welcome to the Sorcery wiki!

This wiki is a work in progress **and it looks like it**.


[[Changelog]]


### Summary:

Sorcery aims to make your life easier by giving you an easy API to write your own user authentication flow with.

Sorcery does this with a few assumptions in mind:

* Less is more - less than 20 simple methods to remember for the entire feature-set make the lib easy to 'get'.
* Every app is different - use the API inside your own MVC structures, and don't fight to fix someone else's.
* Configuration is key - making almost everything configurable means it will be useable in more apps.  

You can see how controllers, models, migrations and views can be used with Sorcery by checking out [this example application](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery-example-app).
