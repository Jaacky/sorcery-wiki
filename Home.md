Welcome to the Sorcery wiki!

This wiki is a work in progress **and it looks like it**.


[[Changelog]]


### Summary:


Sorcery aims to make your life easier by giving you an easy API to write your own user authentication flow with.
It does this with a few goals in mind:

* Less is more - less than 20 simple methods to remember for the entire feature-set make the lib easy to 'get'.
* No built-in or generated code - use the API inside *your own* MVC structures, and don't fight to fix someone else's.
* Magic yes, Voodoo no - the lib should be easy to hack for most developers.
* Configuration over Confusion - Simple & short configuration as possible, not drowning in syntactic sugar.
* Keep MVC cleanly separated - DB is for models, sessions are for controllers. Models stay unaware of sessions.



Hopefully, I've achieved this. If not, let me know.

 

You can see how controllers, models, migrations and views can be used with Sorcery by checking out [this example application](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery-example-app).
