Welcome to the Sorcery wiki!

Sorcery aims to make your life easier by giving you an easy API to write your authentication code with.
However, sorcery does not decide for you how you should authenticate your users and thus does not contain ready-made controllers and other MVC pieces which real applications will change anyway.

By adding small configuration blocks, and calling a few Sorcery methods in your code, your users with be authenticated with ease.

You can see how controllers, models, migrations and views can be used with Sorcery by checking out [this example application](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery-example-app).
